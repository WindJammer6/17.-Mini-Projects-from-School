The project task is to create a generative design in Rhinoceros and Grasshopper using techniques developed aiming to produce something that cannot be recreated using conventional media. The theme of this assignment is “Beyond Human Aptitude”. 

In the '1. Generative Design Project with Rhinoceros and Grasshopper' folder, there are 3 files, consisting of the Grasshopper code, PowerPoint slides and PowerPoint slideshow. Used Photoshop to create the GIF animations in the PowerPoint slides to capture the physical changes in the 3D model as a parameter in the Grasshopper code is changed.

**Summary about the project:**  
The project task is to create a parametric design model using the techniques developed. Produce a scalar field family of surfaces and present variation matrices mapping interactions between parameters. Categorize instances along qualitative and quantitative dimensions and after selecting your favorite option, use 3D printing to produce a physical prototype using a 3D printing software, Ultimaker Cura. The theme of this assignment is “Mapping Variations”. 

In the '2. Parametric Design Project with Rhinoceros and Grasshopper' folder, there are 3 files, consisting of the Grasshopper code, PowerPoint slides and PowerPoint slideshow. Used Photoshop to create the GIF animations in the PowerPoint slides to capture the physical changes in the 3D model as a parameter in the Grasshopper code is changed.

**Summary about the project:**  
The project task is to create a supporting technology project to support a Karaoke Event organised by the school student leadership committee. The technology project I have decided to create is a Web Application using Streamlit (Python Framework) where users can submit their name and song choice via a Streamlit (Python) website link, which will then be added into a database, where another Streamlit (Python) website will draw the data from to display the song queue on a projected screen to show whoever is the next singer and their song choice during the Karaoke Event. 

In the '3. Streamlit (Python) Web Application Project for a Karaoke Event' folder, there are 2 folders, consisting of my learning journey of the Streamlit (Python Framework) (Youtube playlist where I learnt the Streamlit (Python Framework) from: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa6CNrvKM5QU7AjAS90zCMIwi9RTFNIIW by [Nileg Production](https://www.youtube.com/@nilegproduction) (only up till the 14th video in the playlist)) and the Streamlit (Python Framework) Web Application Project itself.

Imrpovements for the project:
#DONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE (maybe can say how many people left before you?)


#Only issue is how to automate when to remove a person from the queue when their song is done? (How do dequeue is easy,
#problem is just when to do it)

You Xiang senior, GitHub app


#DONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
 
#To be improved areas:
#- maybe can say how many people left before the user in the queue
#- automatically dequeue the top singer in the queue after they have finished their song during the Karaoke Evenet

From wikipedia: "Chaos theory is an interdisciplinary area of scientific study and branch of mathematics focused on underlying patterns and deterministic laws of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions, and were once thought to have completely random states of disorder and irregularities."  

The project task is to solve the Lorenz Equation (a Chaotic system/equation) as given in the question by drawing graphs with varying initial conditions and parameters (∂, r and b) and plotting a graph of y against t.

Not much new here, except that I had to learn how to use the 'solve_ivp' function from the 'scipy.integrate' library specifically to be able to plot the set of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) of the Lorenz Equation using Matplotlib in Python into a graph (link of Youtube video where I learnt how to use the 'solve_ivp' function from the 'scipy.integrate' library: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INBu1Pyj0Is (Physics with Neo))

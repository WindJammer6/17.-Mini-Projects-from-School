The project task is to create a generative design in Rhinoceros and Grasshopper using techniques developed aiming to produce something that cannot be recreated using conventional media. The theme of this assignment is “Beyond Human Aptitude”.

In the '1. Generative Design Project with Rhinoceros and Grasshopper' folder, there are 3 files, consisting of the Grasshopper code, PowerPoint slides and PowerPoint slideshow. Used Photoshop to create the GIF animations in the PowerPoint slides to capture the physical changes in the 3D model as a parameter in the Grasshopper code is changed.

**Summary about the project:**  
The project task is to create a parametric design model using the techniques developed. Produce a scalar field family of surfaces and present variation matrices mapping interactions between parameters. Categorize instances along qualitative and quantitative dimensions and after selecting your favorite option, use 3D printing to produce a physical prototype using a 3D printing software, Ultimaker Cura. The theme of this assignment is “Mapping Variations”. 

In the '2. Parametric Design Project with Rhinoceros and Grasshopper' folder, there are 3 files, consisting of the Grasshopper code, PowerPoint slides and PowerPoint slideshow. Used Photoshop to create the GIF animations in the PowerPoint slides to capture the physical changes in the 3D model as a parameter in the Grasshopper code is changed.

**Summary about the project:**  
The project task is to create a supporting technology project to support a Karaoke Event (titled SingUTD), organised by me and other members of the student committee of our school. To meet the tasks required, I have decided to create 2 Web Applications using Streamlit (Python Framework), linked together via Firebase (API)'s Realtime Database. The first Web Application allows users to submit their name and song choice via a Streamlit (Python) website link, where the data will then be added into the Firebase (API)'s Realtime Database, where the other Streamlit (Python) Web Application will draw the data from to display the data in a song queue on a projected screen during the Karaoke Event to show whoever is the next singer and their song choice. 

In the '3. Streamlit (Python) Web Application Project for a Karaoke Event' folder, there are 4 folders:  
+ 'Streamlit (Python Framework) learn' - consists of my learning journey of the Streamlit (Python Framework) (Youtube playlist where I learnt the Streamlit (Python Framework) from: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa6CNrvKM5QU7AjAS90zCMIwi9RTFNIIW by [Nileg Production](https://www.youtube.com/@nilegproduction) (only up till the 14th video in the playlist)
+ '(deployed, using Firebase as database) Streamlit (Python Framework) and Firebase ROOTech Karaoke Night project' - consists of the files that are required for the deployment of the main version of the Streamlit (Python Framework) Web Application Project with the Firebase (API) itself. The deployed Streamlit (Python Framework) Web Application and Firebase (API) Project is linked to this Github account. [18.-Deployed-Streamlit-Python-and-Firebase-Web-Application-Project-for-a-Karaoke-Event](https://github.com/WindJammer6/18.-Deployed-Streamlit-Python-and-Firebase-Web-Application-Project-for-a-Karaoke-Event) is the repository that is linked to the deployed Streamlit (Python Framework) and Firebase (API) Web Application Project, and it has the exact same files in this folder. The purpose of each file is explained in the 'README.md' file in this [other repository](https://github.com/WindJammer6/18.-Deployed-Streamlit-Python-and-Firebase-Web-Application-Project-for-a-Karaoke-Event). Names of the files are shortened compared to the files in the '(main, using Firebase as database) Streamlit (Python Framework) and Firebase ROOTech Karaoke Night project' folder to prevent any errors caused by long file names during deployment.
+ '(main, using Firebase as database) Streamlit (Python Framework) and Firebase ROOTech Karaoke Night project' - consists of the files that contains the code for the main version of the Streamlit (Python Framework) Web Application Project with the Firebase (API). (excludes the supporting files required for deployment of the Streamlit (Python Framework) and Firebase (API) Web Application Project with detailed namings of the files)
+ '(prototype, using csv file as database) Streamlit (Python Framework) ROOTech Karaoke Night project' - consists of the files that contains the prototype version of the Streamlit (Python Framework) Web Application Project, but it uses a CSV file as a 'database' rather than the Firebase (API). However, a senior eventually mentioned that this will not work as a CSV file is not dynamic, and will be unchangable/static when it is deployed, which will not work as the project needs to be dynamic, where the database needs to be able to be constantly updated during the deployment. This is where the connecting the 2 Streamlit Web Applications to an alternate database such as Firebase (API)'s Realtime Database solves the problem.

*This project's deployed Streamlit (Python Framework)'s Web Applications and Firebase (API) links:*
+ https://8kbtr2cyktbh4qn2doay5g.streamlit.app/ (Karaoke Singer Registration Streamlit (Python Framework) Web Application)
+ https://2bgope7myic8tuh3dy6vi4.streamlit.app/ (Song queue display Streamlit (Python Framework) Web Application)
+ https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/karaokeeventproject/database/karaokeeventproject-default-rtdb/data (Direct link to this project's Firebase (API) Realtime database, but only accessible by me through email)  

*Potential Improvements:*
- Automating the process, where after the end of a song, the song queue removes the top singer in the song queue who has completed their song
- Add a functionality where the registration Streamlit (Python Framework) Web Application tells the user, upon submitting their registration details, how many other users are in front of them in the song queue

*Additional Link(s):*
+ https://streamlit.io/cloud (Streamlit (Python Framework)'s cloud software where you can deploy your Streamlit (Python Framework) Web Application)
+ https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/ (Firebase (API) software)

**Summary about the project:**  
+ The first Lorenz Equation graph has the initial conditions of x=0, y=1, z=0, and parameters of ∂=10, r=28, b=8/3 and represents Chaos in the Lorenz Equation solutions.  
+ The second Lorenz Equation graph has the initial conditions of x=-25, y=-10, z=-13.9, and parameters of ∂=10, r=21, b=8/3 and represents Transient Chaos in the Lorenz Equation solutions.  
+ The third Lorenz Equation graph has the initial conditions of x=0, y=1, z=0, and parameters of ∂=10, r=350, b=8/3 and represents no Chaos in the Lorenz Equation solutions.  

From wikipedia: "Chaos theory is an interdisciplinary area of scientific study and branch of mathematics focused on underlying patterns and deterministic laws of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions, and were once thought to have completely random states of disorder and irregularities." 

The project task is to solve the Lorenz Equation (a Chaotic system/equation) as given in the question by drawing graphs with varying initial conditions and parameters (∂, r and b) and plotting y against t for the graphs.

Not much new here, except that I had to learn how to use the 'solve_ivp' function from the 'scipy.integrate' library specifically to be able to plot the set of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) of the Lorenz Equation using Matplotlib in Python into a graph (link of Youtube video where I learnt how to use the 'solve_ivp' function from the 'scipy.integrate' library: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INBu1Pyj0Is (Physics with Neo))
